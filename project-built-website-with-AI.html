              <span style="color:#7000ff;font-size:35px;">ZERO Coding Experience, No Paid Platforms: <br>How I Built My Portfolio Website from Scratch (With AI!)</span><br><br><br>
              Yes, this website was made by me—a complete coding novice. But with a bit of courage and a lot of help from AI, I took on the challenge and made it happen.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Goal: A Website for Just $10 a Year</span><br><br>
              I wondered if it was possible to create a web portfolio for around $10 per year. ChatGPT bluntly told me, “The only way is to write the code yourself.” Excuse me? That’s a joke, right? <br>But then I thought, why not let AI do it for me? With that spark of curiosity, I decided to give it a shot.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Starting from Zero: Asking AI to Build a Portfolio</span><br><br>
              I started by asking AI to help me create a basic portfolio. I wanted a layout where clicking an image opened a content page. Easy, right?
              Well, not exactly.<br>
              When ChatGPT gave me a wall of code filled with red and green lines, I had no idea what to do with it. But AI turned out to be an incredibly patient teacher, answering every silly question I threw its way. Slowly but surely, I embarked on my coding adventure.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Trial, Error, and Frustration</span><br><br>
              Here’s how my workflow went:<br>
              1.	1.	Ask AI a question or describe a layout idea.<br>
              2.	Receive a block of code with explanations.<br>
              3.	Copy-paste it into Atom and test it in Chrome.<br>
              4.	Make adjustments when things didn’t look right.<br><br>
              This process repeated dozens of times. For every issue, I had to dig deeper. Sometimes, AI would add visual effects I didn’t ask for, forcing me to fix them with new questions. <br>Here are some examples of what I asked:<br>
              •	“Does this code create a responsive website?”<br>
              •	“For .portfolio-item:hover, I don’t want the image to scale. Can it play a video instead?”<br>
              •	“In my CSS, my header looks like this: header { width: 100%; padding: 20px 0; background-color: #ffffff; text-align: left; }. How can I add space to the left of my logo?”<br>
              •	“What does height: auto mean? I want my header shorter. How can I do this?”<br>
              •	“Here’s my CSS code: [example]. How can I ensure all project images on the index page are square? Please specify which parts to change.”<br>
              •	“Why aren’t my project descriptions in three columns? My images aren’t displaying in two columns either!”<br>
              ...<br>
              Sometimes I got stuck on ridiculously simple things, like centering text. And AI wasn’t perfect—it didn’t always have the right answer. When that happened, I switched to another AI tool or tried different solutions myself.
              <br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Learning Along the Way</span><br><br>
              Eventually, I realized I needed to understand some basics to fix certain issues. Margins, font sizes, colors—these started to make sense. Most of the code still felt alien, but thanks to AI’s patient guidance, I made steady progress.<br>
              After a week of trial and error, I finally had a layout I liked. And guess what? I felt like half a coder! Plus, my English writing skills improved a lot during this process.<br><br>


              <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Multilingual Challenge</span><br><br>
              Next, I decided to make my website multilingual—English, French, and Chinese. That’s three versions of every page.<br>
              Many platforms offer tools to simplify this, but since I was coding manually, I had to create and link each version myself. For every French project page, I had to ensure the menu linked back to the French main page—not the English one.<br>
              It was tedious. I had 12 projects to showcase, meaning I had to check and fix the menu links 36 times.<br>
              AI helped with translations, but the Chinese results often sounded awkward, like a beginner struggling to speak the language. To fix this, I copied the text from ChatGPT or Gemini and refined it using Doubao, a more fluent Chinese AI model.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tackling SEO</span><br><br>
              Next up: Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It’s not glamorous, but it’s crucial if you want people to find your website.
              AI broke it down step by step, making it manageable. I added language tags to every page, generated SEO-friendly titles and descriptions, and even renamed my image and video files to improve search rankings.
              Honestly, I’ve never used such long file names before, but if it helps with SEO, I'm all in!<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hosting for Free</span><br><br>
              Finally, I had to get my website online.<br>
              Initially, I tried hosting it on someone else’s server, but it lacked SSL security. After days of frustration, I gave up and asked AI, “Where can I host my website for free?”<br>
              The answer: GitHub.<br>
              Wait, GitHub? The place where all the cool, smart developers hang out? I was intimidated but excited to join their ranks. With AI guiding me step by step, I navigated the technical jargon and uploaded my first website folder. Voilà! My portfolio was live!<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Touches</span><br><br>
              With the basics done, I asked AI for help with finishing touches:<br>
              •	“What’s the recommended image size for web use?”<br>
              •	“How can I add a favicon?”<br>
              •	“How do I track my site’s performance?”<br>
              AI answered everything, making the process feel like striking gold with every question.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">What I Learned</span><br><br>
              Building my website from scratch wasn’t easy, but it was incredibly rewarding. For a learning enthusiast like me, AI proved to be the ultimate personal tutor—answering every question without judgment.<br>
              This journey taught me that with motivation and passion, anyone can learn anything. AI tools are powerful amplifiers of your potential.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">AI tools I used:</span><br><br>
              •	ChatGPT (free version)
              •	Gemini
              •	Doubao (for better Chinese translations)<br>
              Thinking about building your own website? Go for it! If I can do it, so can you.<br><br>
