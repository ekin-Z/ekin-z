              <span style="color:#7000ff;font-size:35px;">ZERO Coding Experience, No Paid Platforms: <br>How I Built My Portfolio Website from Scratch (With AI!)</span><br><br>
              Having a portfolio website is essential for any designer. But let’s be honest—how many of us neglect it once it’s up and running? That was me. I had my website on a free plan with a platform and barely updated it. My clients were happy, so I just let it be.<br>
              Then one day, I logged in, and surprise—the platform was no longer free. Not only that, I couldn’t make changes to my website anymore.<br>
              When I checked my dashboard, my heart sank. They wanted 200 euros a year just to keep my site live. That’s when I realized I needed another solution—a cheaper one. I didn’t need anything fancy, just a simple site to showcase my projects. But how could I do it?<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">The AI Solution</span><br>
              I turned to AI for help. “How can I build my own website without spending a fortune?” I asked.<br>
              AI suggested using another website builder. But the problem? These “cheaper” options were still 100+ euros a year. Nope, not for me. I wanted something closer to 10 euros a year, with a personal domain and basic functionality.<br>
              That’s when I had a wild idea: what if I built it myself? I had no experience coding, but AI had been making headlines for doing everything. Maybe, just maybe, I could make it work.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">My Coding Adventure</span><br>
              I started by asking AI to help me create a basic portfolio. I wanted a layout where clicking an image opened a content page. Easy, right?
              Well, not exactly.<br>
              AI sent back a wall of code—lines of red and green that made no sense to me. What was I supposed to do? I needed a code editor (I chose Atom) and a browser (Chrome). With those tools in hand, I copy-pasted the code and crossed my fingers.<br>
              It worked... sort of. The layout appeared, but it wasn’t quite what I wanted. That’s when the real work began.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Here’s how my workflow looked:</span><br>
              1.	Ask AI a question or share a rough layout idea.<br>
              2.	Receive a block of code with explanations.<br>
              3.	Copy-paste it into Atom and test it in Chrome.<br>
              4.	Make adjustments when things didn’t look right.<br>
              This process repeated dozens of times. Sometimes, I got stuck on silly things, like centering text. Other times, I had to describe my problem more clearly for AI to understand. I even tried asking different AI models when one didn’t give me the answer I needed.
              Eventually, I realized that to fix certain issues, I needed to understand the code myself. Slowly but surely, margins, font sizes, and colors started to make sense. It was like learning a new language—but with an incredibly patient AI tutor.
              After a week of trial and error, I had a layout I loved. And guess what? I felt like half a coder!<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Multilingual Challenge</span><br>
              Next, I decided to make my website multilingual—English, French, and Chinese. That’s three versions of every page.<br>
              Many platforms offer tools to simplify this, but since I was coding manually, I had to create and link each version myself. For every French project page, I had to ensure the menu linked back to the French main page—not the English one.<br>
              It was tedious. I had 12 projects to showcase, meaning I had to check and fix the menu links 36 times.<br>
              Thankfully, AI was a lifesaver for the translations. I simply asked, “Translate this into French and Chinese,” and within a day, all my text was ready.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">SEO: The Necessary Evil</span><br>
              Search Engine Optimization (SEO) was next. It’s not glamorous, but it’s crucial if you want people to find your website.<br>
              AI broke it down step by step, making it manageable. I added language tags to every page, generated SEO-friendly titles and descriptions, and even renamed my image and video files to improve search rankings.<br>
              Honestly, I’ve never used such long file names before, but if it helps with SEO, I’ll take it!<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Hosting for Free</span><br>
              Finally, I had to get my website online.
              At first, I tried hosting it on someone else’s server. While it worked, it wasn’t secure—no SSL! After days of frustration and even contacting the server’s support team, I gave up.<br>
              I turned back to AI: “Where can I host my website for free?”
              The answer: GitHub.
              At first, I was intimidated. GitHub felt like a space for super-smart developers. But after everything I’d learned, I wasn’t afraid to dive in. With AI guiding me step by step, I uploaded my files, and voilà—my portfolio was live!<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Final Touches</span><br>
              To track my site’s performance, I added Google Analytics. AI provided a simple guide, making the setup a breeze.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">What I Learned</span><br>
              With AI, I realized I could learn almost anything. You don’t need prior experience—just motivation and patience. AI was like having a personal tutor, answering every question without judgment.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">AI tools I used:</span><br>
              •	ChatGPT (free version)
              •	Gemini
              •	Doubao (for translating Chinese descriptions—it was more flexible than ChatGPT).<br>
              Thinking about building your own website? Go for it! If I can do it, so can you.<br><br>

              <span style="font-weight:bold;">Why This Approach Worked for Me</span><br>
              While it wasn’t the easiest route, building my website from scratch taught me so much. And it didn’t cost a fortune! If you’re a designer or creative who wants more control over your portfolio, this journey might be for you too.<br>
